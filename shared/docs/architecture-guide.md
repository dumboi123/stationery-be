# Microservices Architecture Guide

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for implementing and maintaining our microservices architecture across multiple programming languages.

## Service Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each service should have one clear business responsibility:
- **User Service**: User management and authentication
- **Product Service**: Product catalog management
- **Inventory Service**: Stock level management
- **Cart Service**: Shopping cart operations
- **Order Service**: Order processing and management
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing
- **Blog Service**: Content management with AI
- **Analytics Service**: Data analysis and reporting
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and aggregation

### 2. Database Per Service
Each service owns its database completely:
- No direct database access between services
- Communication only through APIs/events
- Different database technologies based on needs

### 3. Decentralized Data Management
- Each service manages its own data lifecycle
- Event-driven synchronization for data consistency
- No shared data models between services

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
```
Client → API Gateway → Service (REST/gRPC)
Service A → Service B (gRPC for internal calls)
```

### Asynchronous Communication
```
Service A → Event Bus (Kafka) → Service B
Service A → Message Queue → Service B
```

## Technology Choices

### Programming Languages
- **Go**: High-performance services (User, Inventory, Payment)
- **Python**: Rapid development services (Product)
- **Node.js**: I/O intensive services (API Gateway, Cart, Blog)
- **Java**: Enterprise services (Order, Analytics)

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance (User, Payment, Blog)
- **MongoDB**: Flexible schema (Product, Inventory)
- **Oracle**: Enterprise features (Order, Analytics)
- **Redis**: Caching and sessions (API Gateway, Cart)

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- OAuth2 for third-party integrations
- Service-to-service authentication via mTLS

### Authorization
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Resource-level permissions
- API key management for external access

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secret management via environment variables

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics
- Business metrics: orders/sec, revenue, user signups
- Technical metrics: response time, error rate, throughput
- Infrastructure metrics: CPU, memory, disk usage

### Logging
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Centralized log aggregation

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error propagation tracking

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
Each service should follow language-specific conventions:

```
service-name/
├── cmd/                 # Go: Entry points
├── internal/            # Go: Private packages
├── app/                 # Python: Application code
├── src/                 # Node.js/Java: Source code
├── tests/               # Test files
├── database/            # Database migrations/seeds
├── proto/               # Generated gRPC code
├── Dockerfile           # Container definition
├── docker-compose.yml   # Local development
└── README.md            # Service documentation
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Contract tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows

### Deployment
- Container-based deployment (Docker)
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": "Additional context",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-13T10:30:00Z",
    "path": "/api/endpoint"
  }
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Fail fast when dependent services are down
- Graceful degradation of functionality
- Automatic recovery when services are restored

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Application-level caching for computed results
- Database query result caching
- CDN for static content delivery
- Redis for session and temporary data

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing strategies
- Connection pooling
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Query optimization and monitoring

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless service design
- Load balancing across instances
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- Resource isolation per service

### Data Partitioning
- Shard databases by tenant or geography
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- CQRS for read/write separation
- Eventually consistent operations

## Migration and Versioning

### API Versioning
- Semantic versioning for APIs
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Gradual migration strategies
- Deprecation policies

### Database Migrations
- Forward-only migrations
- Zero-downtime migration strategies
- Rollback procedures
- Data validation after migrations
